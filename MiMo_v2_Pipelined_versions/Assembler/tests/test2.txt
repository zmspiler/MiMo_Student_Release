.text

mov r1, #4	 @cycle 5
mov r2, #5	 @cycle 6
mov r3, #3	 @cycle 7
mov r4, #5	 @cycle 8
nop
cmp r1, r2	 @cycle 10
nop		 @cycle 11, has to be added because the result of the flags is known one stage late
addeq r5, r1, r2 @cycle 12
addcs r0, r1,r2  @cycle 13, does not execute because condition is not met but we only lose one cycle
subs r6, r3, r4  @cycle 14
nop		 @cycle 15
remne r7, r3, r4 @cycle 16
