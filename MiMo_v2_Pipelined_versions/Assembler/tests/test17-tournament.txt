@testing tournament predictor
@correlating predictor is not always better than a standard 2-bit predictor
@Sometimes, unrelated jumps may affect the correlating predictor and make predictions worse.
@To account for that, we use a tournament predictor,
@ that dinamically chooses whether to to predict using local history(as a correlating predictor) or global history(2-bit predictor)
@ we'll take the same code as with our correlating predictor, but expand it with an extra jump

/*
Branch outcomes:
jump1		TNTNTNTNTNTNTNTN
jump2 		NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
jump3		TNTNTNTNTNTNTNTN

Correlating predictor predictions:
jump1		NNNNNNTNTNTN
jump2 		NNNNNTNTNTNT
jump3		NNNNTNTNTNTN

Because of the extra independent jump, 
our local history table is being modified and we are incorrectly predicting every 2nd jump2 using the correlating predictor.

Tournament predictions:
jump1		NNNNNNTNTNTN
jump2 		NNNNNNNNNNNN
jump3		NNNNTNTNTNTN

After the 5th iteration of jump2, the tournamnet predictor is always correct
